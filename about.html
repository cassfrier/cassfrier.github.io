            Howdy! My name is Cassidy Frier and I'm a senior computer science major at Texas A&M University.
            I have minors in mathematics and cybersecurity.
            In my free time, I enjoy dancing, spending time with friends, and reading.
            Before attending Texas A&M University, I spent two years at the University of North Texas
            as part of the <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf;color: white;" HREF = "https://tams.unt.edu">Texas Academy of Math and Science</a> program.
            This program allowed me to take college courses while still in high school and live on campus in a dorm.
            I was able to graduate high school with 64 college credit hours and enroll in TAMU as a junior.
            While at TAMS, I volunteered at the local animal shelter and Denton Teen Court. In my first semester at TAMU,
            I joined the <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf;color: white;" HREF = "https://swe.org">Society of Women Engineers.</a>
            I participated in SWENext, a program for high schoolers to explore the different fields of engineering.
            My work experience throughout my high school and college careers has helped me gain skills that I
            will take into my career. One summer, I worked as a Teaching Assistant at TAMS's <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf; color: white;"
            HREF = "https://tams.unt.edu/sites/default/files/static/academics/SMI/smibrochure.pdf">Summer Math Institute.</a>
            I helped the Algebra II teacher instruct the class and tutored the students one-on-one. During my first
            year at TAMU, I worked for <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf; color: white;" HREF = "https://www.thegraidenetwork.com">The Graide Network.</a>
            I gave individualized feedback to hundreds of students on essays from grades K-12.
            During my second year at TAMU, I worked for <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf; color: white;" HREF = "https://www.northpoint-crossing.com">Northpoint Crossing</a>
            as a leasing agent. This job taught me customer service skills as well as administrative skills.
            This summer, I'm working as a server at <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf;color: white;" HREF = "https://chilis.com">Chili's.</a>. This job has taught
            me a lot about customer service and working well under pressure. After college, 
            I plan to join the workforce and become a software engineer.
