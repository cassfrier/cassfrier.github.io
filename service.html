                In high school, I volunteered at the <a style = "background-color:#6dbdaf; color: white;" HREF = "https://www.dentonasf.com">Denton Animal Shelter.</a>
                I helped clean cages and windows, did laundry and dishes, 
                played with animals and gave them love and affection,
                and took dogs on walks.
                I also volunteered at Denton Teen Court, where I
                served on jury duty and eventually became an attorney
