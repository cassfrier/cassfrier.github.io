                This product is designed to provide a competitive advantage for GalaxyBucks over competitors
                in the Bryan / College Station area. In order to stay ahead of the competition, this revamp of
                GalaxyBuckâ€™s ordering system is introducing an interactive UI for placing orders, providing
                recommendations based on buying trends in the past, and customizing menu items to better satisfy
                customers. The graphical interface is simple and easy to navigate, leading to faster and more efficient
                orders for customers and employees. The goal for these specific features is to provide a faster and easier
                ordering system for customers, and make a more cost-effective management system for the company at large.

                Imagine it's a Friday night and you're hanging out with friends and someone suggests that you
                all watch a movie. Sounds great, but how do you decide which movie to watch? GroupMovie makes this process easy.
                You can create a new virtual room and select which streaming services members of the group have. Once everyone
                has joined the room, voting begins. Different movies are shown based on the given streaming services with a search option included. Once the timer runs out, the top movies are put in a tournament and the group now has
                movies to watch that they actually want to see! No more wasting time trying to pick a movie that everyone will
                agree on, only to end up with nothing. Our app will make the process much faster and achieve results that everyone
                in the group is happy with.
