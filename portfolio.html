                <br>This project consists of an analysis of the
                demographics of US Police Shooting victims.
                Our initial question was: "Can certain
                demographics effect someone's chance of
                experiencing police violence?" After getting
                feedback from peers and cleaning our data,
                this question evolved to look at how many
                encounters actually became violent and how are
                levels of violence evolving based on age (police
                use of force for people over 50 vs. people under 30).
                New questions that were considered throughout the
                analysis: "How do the levels of force vary by race?"
                "How effective are certain types of force used?"
                We created a Google Colaboratory with all the
                steps taken to gather insight into this topic.

                This product is designed to provide a competitive advantage for GalaxyBucks over competitors
                in the Bryan / College Station area. In order to stay ahead of the competition, this revamp of
                GalaxyBuckâ€™s ordering system is introducing an interactive UI for placing orders, providing
                recommendations based on buying trends in the past, and customizing menu items to better satisfy
                customers. The graphical interface is simple and easy to navigate, leading to faster and more efficient
                orders for customers and employees. The goal for these specific features is to provide a faster and easier
                ordering system for customers, and make a more cost-effective management system for the company at large.

                COMING SOON! Imagine it's a Friday night and you're hanging out with friends and someone suggests that you
                all watch a movie. Sounds great, but how do you decide which movie to watch? GroupMovie makes this process easy.
                You can create a new virtual room and select which streaming services members of the group have. Once everyone
                has joined the room, voting begins. Different movies are recommended as the voting goes on and the preferences
                of the group are learned. Once the timer runs out, the top movies are put in a tournament and the group now has
                movies to watch that they actually want to see! No more wasting time trying to pick a movie that everyone will
                agree on, only to end up with nothing. Our app will make the process much faster and achieve results that everyone
                in the group is happy with.
