                (completed with three other group members):
                <br>This project consists of an analysis of the 
                demographics of US Police Shooting victims. 
                Our initial question was: "Can certain 
                demographics effect someone's chance of 
                experiencing police violence?" After getting 
                feedback from peers and cleaning our data, 
                this question evolved to look at how many 
                encounters actually became violent and how are 
                levels of violence evolving based on age (police 
                use of force for people over 50 vs. people under 30). 
                New questions that were considered throughout the 
                analysis: "How do the levels of force vary by race?" 
                "How effective are certain types of force used?" 
                We created a Google Colaboratory with all the 
                steps taken to gather insight into this topic.

                An idea I have for a future project is a dating app. Unlike mainstream apps, like Tinder or Bumble,
                this app would have more of a social media feel, similar to Instagram. You could look through 
                multiple people at once instead of having to make a decision on one person before you can view the next
                one. You could put in as many features as you want and the algorithm picks people that have those features 
                to put on your home feed. You can also search for certain qualities and look through multiple people to find
                someone you want to meet. I plan to use Swift to design this app.
